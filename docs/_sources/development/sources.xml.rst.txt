Getting the Sources
-------------------

By default, NixOS’s :command:`nixos-rebuild` command uses the NixOS
and Nixpkgs sources provided by the ``nixos`` channel (kept in
:file:`/nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/root/channels/nixos`). To
modify NixOS, however, you should check out the latest sources from Git. This
is as follows:
::

    $ git clone https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs$ cd nixpkgs$ git remote update origin

This will check out the latest Nixpkgs sources to
:file:`./nixpkgs` the NixOS sources to
:file:`./nixpkgs/nixos`. (The NixOS source tree lives in a
subdirectory of the Nixpkgs repository.) The
``nixpkgs`` repository has branches that correspond
to each Nixpkgs/NixOS channel (see :ref:`sec-upgrading` for more
information about channels). Thus, the Git branch
``origin/nixos-17.03`` will contain the latest built and
tested version available in the ``nixos-17.03`` channel.

It’s often inconvenient to develop directly on the master branch, since if
somebody has just committed (say) a change to GCC, then the binary cache may
not have caught up yet and you’ll have to rebuild everything from source.
So you may want to create a local branch based on your current NixOS version:
::

    $ nixos-version
    17.09pre104379.6e0b727 (Hummingbird)
    $ git checkout -b local 6e0b727

Or, to base your local branch on the latest version available in a NixOS
channel:
::

    $ git remote update origin$ git checkout -b local origin/nixos-17.03

(Replace ``nixos-17.03`` with the name of the channel you want
to use.) You can use :command:`git merge` or :command:`git
rebase` to keep your local branch in sync with the channel, e.g.
::

    $ git remote update origin$ git merge origin/nixos-17.03

You can use :command:`git cherry-pick` to copy commits from your
local branch to the upstream branch.

If you want to rebuild your system using your (modified) sources, you need to
tell :command:`nixos-rebuild` about them using the
flag:
::

    # nixos-rebuild switch -I nixpkgs=*/my/sources*/nixpkgs

If you want :command:`nix-env` to use the expressions in
*/my/sources*, use :command:`nix-env -f
*/my/sources*/nixpkgs`, or change the
default by adding a symlink in :file:`~/.nix-defexpr`:
::

    $ ln -s */my/sources*/nixpkgs ~/.nix-defexpr/nixpkgs

You may want to delete the symlink
:file:`~/.nix-defexpr/channels_root` to prevent root’s NixOS
channel from clashing with your own tree (this may break the
command-not-found utility though). If you want to go back to the default
state, you may just remove the :file:`~/.nix-defexpr` directory
completely, log out and log in again and it should have been recreated with a
link to the root channels.

.. COMMENT: FIXME: not sure what this means.
            <para>You should not pass the base directory
            <filename><replaceable>/my/sources</replaceable></filename>
            to <command>nix-env</command>, as it will break after interpreting expressions
            in <filename>nixos/</filename> as packages.</para>
