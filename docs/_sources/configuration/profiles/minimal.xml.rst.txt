Minimal
~~~~~~~

This profile defines a small NixOS configuration. It does not contain any
graphical stuff. It's a very short file that enables
`noXlibs <None>`_, sets
`i18n.supportedLocales <None>`_ to
only support the user-selected locale,
`disables packages' documentation <None>`_, and `disables sound <None>`_.
