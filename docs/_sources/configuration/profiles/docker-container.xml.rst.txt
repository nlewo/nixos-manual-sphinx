Docker Container
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the profile from which the Docker images are generated. It prepares a
working system by importing the
`Minimal <None>`_ and
`Clone Config <None>`_ profiles, and
setting appropriate configuration options that are useful inside a container
context, like :ref:`opt-boot.isContainer`.
