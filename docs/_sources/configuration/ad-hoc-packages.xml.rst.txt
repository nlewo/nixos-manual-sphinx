Ad-Hoc Package Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the command :command:`nix-env`, you can install and uninstall
packages from the command line. For instance, to install Mozilla Thunderbird:
::

    $ nix-env -iA nixos.thunderbird

If you invoke this as root, the package is installed in the Nix profile
:file:`/nix/var/nix/profiles/default` and visible to all users
of the system; otherwise, the package ends up in
:file:`/nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/`
and is not visible to other users. The flag specifies the
package by its attribute name; without it, the package is installed by
matching against its package name (e.g. ``thunderbird``). The
latter is slower because it requires matching against all available Nix
packages, and is ambiguous if there are multiple matching packages.

Packages come from the NixOS channel. You typically upgrade a package by
updating to the latest version of the NixOS channel:
::

    $ nix-channel --update nixos

and then running ``nix-env -i`` again. Other packages in the
profile are *not* affected; this is the crucial difference
with the declarative style of package management, where running
:command:`nixos-rebuild switch` causes all packages to be updated to
their current versions in the NixOS channel. You can however upgrade all
packages for which there is a newer version by doing:
::

    $ nix-env -u '\*'

A package can be uninstalled using the flag:
::

    $ nix-env -e thunderbird

Finally, you can roll back an undesirable :command:`nix-env` action:
::

    $ nix-env --rollback

:command:`nix-env` has many more flags. For details, see the

nix-env
1 manpage or the Nix manual.
