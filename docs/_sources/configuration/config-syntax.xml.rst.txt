Configuration Syntax
--------------------

The NixOS configuration file
:file:`/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` is actually a *Nix
expression*, which is the Nix package managerâ€™s purely functional
language for describing how to build packages and configurations. This means
you have all the expressive power of that language at your disposal,
including the ability to abstract over common patterns, which is very useful
when managing complex systems. The syntax and semantics of the Nix language
are fully described in the
`Nix
manual <http://nixos.org/nix/manual/#chap-writing-nix-expressions>`_, but here we give a short overview of the most important
constructs useful in NixOS configuration files.
